# MODIFY THIS README FILE TO CORRESPOND TO YOUR DATA# KEEP IT BRIEF; THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR DATA# BUT JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW TO GET A QUICK IDEA# FOLLOW THE STRUCTURE AND STYLE OF THIS FILE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLEThis README.text file includes the basic information about the dataset coded asLi_Yuanheng #change this line!# MAIN QUESTION/AIM OF THE STUDY IN ONE SENTENCE:To predict Malaise-trapped arthropod biodiversity in a continuous forest mosaic as a function of remote-sensing variables (LiDAR, multispectral) and standard GIS-type variables (e.g. elevation, distance to road), with the goal of co-managing a US working forest for timber production and biodiversity.# SPECIES DATA (Y)The species data consists of 'counts' (fsl_xxx)/occurence (present_xxx) of 1147 invertebrate species.# STUDY DESIGN (S)The study design is 94 sampling points across the HJ Andrews Forest. There were two sessions of trapping (S1 and S2), and in each session, we usually used one Malaise trap (M1) but used two traps times (M2). The samples sizes are S1/M1 = 87, S1/M2 = 33, S2/M1 = 90, S2/M2 = 25. There was a distant forest fire between S1 and S2, which resulted in a lot of smoke at HJA. This, plus just time, means that the communities between S1 and S2 are quite different. Thus, our idea is to use M1 in each session as a training set, and M2 as the testing set. The sample name is in the column "SiteName", and site coordinates are in columns "UTM_E" and "UTM_N".Session is in column 'session'Malaise trap is in column 'trap'# COVARIATES (X)There are three sets of covariates, which for convenience, we call "Ground", "Multispectral", and "LiDAR".  GROUND elevation (continuous): elevation (meter) of the sampling pointcanopy.ht (continuous): mean canopy height (meter) of the sampling pointmin.T (continuous): annual minimum temperaturemax.T (continuous): annual maximum temperatureprecipitation (continuous): annual precipitationmetre.road (continuous): distance to road (meter)metre.stream (continuous): distance to stream (meter)yrs.disturb.min (numeric): years since last disturbancehja (factor): inside or outside the HJA Experimental ForestMULTISPECTRALmean.NDVI (continuous): mean normalized difference vegetation index calculated using multispectral satellite datamean.EVI (continuous): enhanced vegetation index calculated using multispectral satellite datamean.green.

So for the pilot model, we suggest a simple main-effects model using only the Ground variables. We don't have any a priori ideas for interactions.elevation + canopy.ht + min.T + metre.road + metre.stream + yrs.disturb.min + hjaThe longer-term idea is to test if the Multispectral and/or LiDAR variables can exceed the Ground variables in explanatory and predictive power, and to see how well Multispectral and/or LiDAR variables perform in an absolute sense. Transformations suggested for continuous variables:The data are available as 0/1 and as quasiprobabilities [0-1], where the latter were achieved using a DNA standard spike-in. Both of these are suitable for a probit model.# TRAITS (Tr)None# HOW TO SET UP A REASONABLE PILOT MODEL FOR TrFormula:N/A# PHYLOGENY (P)None# CAN WE USE YOUR DATA AS EXAMPLE IN THE COURSE: YES # change to NO as needed (?) # DO YOU POTENTIALLY WISH TO COLLABORATE WITH YOUR DATA ANALYSES AT THE LEVEL OF CO-AUTHORSHIP: YES # change to "NO" or "MAYBE" as needed (?)The default plan is that we will advise you during the course with your data analyses, including setting up and fitting the models, interpreting the results, and writing the paper. If you find our advice useful, we would like you to mention that in the acknowledgements. If you wish, we may also be able to take a more active role in your manuscript preparation, so that a co-authorship becomes justified. If you answer "YES", this means that in principle you would welcome such a contribution. Of course, whether an instructor from the course eventually becomes a co-author or not will depend on their actual level of contribution to the manuscript.
