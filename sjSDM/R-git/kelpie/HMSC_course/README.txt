# MODIFY THIS README FILE TO CORRESPOND TO YOUR DATA# KEEP IT BRIEF; THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF YOUR DATA# BUT JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW TO GET A QUICK IDEA# FOLLOW THE STRUCTURE AND STYLE OF THIS FILE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLEThis README.text file includes the basic information about the dataset coded asLi_Yuanheng #change this line!# MAIN QUESTION/AIM OF THE STUDY IN ONE SENTENCE:How the occurrence/abundance variation of invertebrates depends on spatial predictors and environmental predictors.# SPECIES DATA (Y)The species data consists of 'counts' (fsl_xxx)/occurence (present_xxx) of 1147 invertebrate species.# STUDY DESIGN (S)The study design contains repeated visits of 94 sampling points equipped with one or two Malaise traps (column 'trap). 34 Samples are set with two traps.The sample name is in the column "SiteName" and its coordinates are in columns "UTM_E" and "UTM_N".The sampling points are visited twice, column "session" (two samples only have info for one visit).# COVARIATES (X)elevation (continuous): elevation (meter) of the sampling pointcanopy.ht (continuous): mean canopy height (meter) of the sampling pointmin.T (continuous): annual minimum temperaturemax.T (continuous): annual maximum temperatureprecipitation (continuous): annual precipitationmetre.road (continuous): distance to road (meter)metre.stream (continuous): distance to stream (meter)yrs.disturb.min (numeric): years since last disturbancehja (factor): inside or outside the forestmean.NDVI/mean.EVI (continuous): mean normalized difference vegetation index/enhanced vegetation index calculated based on multispectual satellite datamean.green/mean.bright/mean.wet. (continuous): mean greeness/brightness/wetness calculated based on multispectual satellite datal_Cover_2m_4m/l_Cover_2m_max/l_Cover_4m_16m/l_p25/l_p95/l_rumple (continuous): Lidar data  xxx.scale: transformed (scaled) version of the specific variablelysis.ratio/spike.mean: used to calculate 'counts' (calibrated OTU reads), probably not useful # HOW TO SET UP A REASONABLE PILOT MODEL FOR XFormula:The three most important predictors are: spatial (coordinates), min.T, yrs.disturb.minTransformations suggested for continuous variables:-log# TRAITS (Tr)NO# HOW TO SET UP A REASONABLE PILOT MODEL FOR TrFormula:NO# PHYLOGENY (P)NO# CAN WE USE YOUR DATA AS EXAMPLE IN THE COURSE: YES # change to NO as needed (?) # DO YOU POTENTIALLY WISH TO COLLABORATE WITH YOUR DATA ANALYSES AT THE LEVEL OF CO-AUTHORSHIP: YES # change to "NO" or "MAYBE" as needed (?)The default plan is that we will advise you during the course with your data analyses, including setting up and fitting the models, interpreting the results, and writing the paper. If you find our advice useful, we would like you to mention that in the acknowledgements. If you wish, we may also be able to take a more active role in your manuscript preparation, so that a co-authorship becomes justified. If you answer "YES", this means that in principle you would welcome such a contribution. Of course, whether an instructor from the course eventually becomes a co-author or not will depend on their actual level of contribution to the manuscript.
